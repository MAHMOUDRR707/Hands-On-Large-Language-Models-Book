## üöÄ Getting Started

Each chapter's directory includes:

- A summary of key concepts.
- Jupyter notebooks with code examples.
- Instructions for running the code.

### Steps to Run the Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hands-On-LLMs.git
    cd Hands-On-LLMs
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    - It's recommended to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for running the notebooks, as it provides free access to GPUs.
    - Alternatively, set up a local environment with the required dependencies.

3. **Open the desired notebook**:
    - Navigate to the chapter's directory.
    - Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
